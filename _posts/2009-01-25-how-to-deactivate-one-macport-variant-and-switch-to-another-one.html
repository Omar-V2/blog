Lets say for instance you have installed PHP with MySQL support with macports:

<code>sudo port install php5 +mysql5</code>

But later on you decide you want to use SQLite, too, you'll have to rebuild PHP with SQLite extensions, like this.

<code>sudo port install php5 +mysql5 +sqlite</code>

Now you have to deactivate the MySQL-only build and activate the one with SQLite bindings. I couldn't find it anywhere in in the macports manual so here it goes.

Get a list of your current PHP5 builds with

<code>$ sudo port activate php5
Password:
---&gt;  The following versions of php5 are currently installed:
---&gt;  	php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx
---&gt;  	php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx+mysql5 (active)
---&gt;  	php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx+mysql5+sqlite
Error: port activate failed: Registry error: Please specify the full version as recorded in the port registry.
</code>
Then copy and paste the currently activated port and use the deactivate command.

<code>sudo port deactivate php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx+mysql5
---&gt;  Deactivating php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx+mysql5
</code>
Then copy and paste the one you would like to use and use the activate command:

<code>sudo port activate php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx+mysql5+sqlite
---&gt;  Activating php5 @5.2.8_1+apache2+macosx+mysql5+sqlite
</code>
That's it.
