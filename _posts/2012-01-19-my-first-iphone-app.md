In the recent months or so I have written my first iPhone app and Apple has approved it last night!

It works only in Germany and will find the nearest cash point for Cash Group, which is an association of Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Postbank and a few others. As someone not living in Germany you may ask Why? Well, if you use a cash point from another bank you will have to pay fees for withdrawing cash, sometimes as high as â‚¬6.

So, without further ado:
