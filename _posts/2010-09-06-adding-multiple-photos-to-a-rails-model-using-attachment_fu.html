<h3>Useless preamble</h3>
This weekend I finished off my own little <a href="https://lenni.info/blog/2010/07/thoughts-about-rails-from-a-django-guy/">Hello World mini-CMS</a>, that I wrote in order to learn Ruby on Rails. The last part meant adding an image uploader, that would allow users attach an image to a page. There are two popular image uploader plugins for Rails: The slightly older, more complicated and feature-rich <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu">attachment_fu</a> and the more nimble <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">paperclip</a>.

Paperclip seems to have the limitation that it only allows one attachment per model instance. On the other hand, you don't need to create a separate model for your attachments. For this project I absolutely needed multiple attachment per page so I went with attachment_fu. I also didn't want a separate form for uploading images, which would mean having to later associated the image with a page - I wanted to be able to upload from the page's editing form. This case doesn't seem to be covered well in attachment_fu's documentation, so this is an attempt of closing this gap.
<h3>Installing the requirements</h3>
You will have to install an image processor. This is described in many other <a href="http://significantbits.wordpress.com/2007/04/06/using-attachment_fu-by-techno-weenie-to-add-image-attachment-support-to-your-rails-application/">blog posts</a> so I won't regurgitate it here. I personally went with ImageMagick and rmagick. Seems to work fine.

Once you've done that you obviously have to install the plugin itself with:
<pre lang="bash">./script/plugin install http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu.git{% endhighlight %}
<strong>Edit:</strong> Rails 3 has been released shortly after I wrote this post and this plugin doesn't work anymore. However there is an alternative branch on Github, which you can install with:

Be warned though that you can't
<h3>Setting up the models</h3>
You will need to use a separate model to store all the attachment meta data. I have called mine Photo but that name is arbitrary - call it what you want. So, lets build a migration:
<pre lang="ruby">class AddPhotos > ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
        create_table :photos do |t|
          t.column :parent_id,  :integer
          t.column :content_type, :string
          t.column :filename, :string
          t.column :thumbnail, :string
          t.column :size, :integer
          t.column :width, :integer
          t.column :height, :integer
          t.column :article_id, :integer
        end
      end

      def self.down
        drop_table :photos
      end
end{% endhighlight %}
Here's the model class. Also, read up on the official docu about the all the possible options - the plugin is really quite flexible.
<pre lang="ruby">class Photo > ActiveRecord::Base

  has_attachment :content_type => :image,
                 :storage => :file_system,
                 :max_size => 2000.kilobytes,
                 :resize_to => '500x500>',
                 :thumbnails => { :thumb => '215x215>'}

  validates_as_attachment

  belongs_to :article
end{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Controller &amp; form</h3>
A lot of tutorials say that you should set up your own controller for the image upload. But that would mean that you have to use a separate form for uploading images. What I wanted to do was to also use the ordinary page editing form for image uploads. So, I found a <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/164189">forum post</a> that put me on the right track and after a bit more of trial and error I figured it out.

First, you need to slightly edit the form where you want to upload the image from. It needs to be a multipart form and you need to add a file field.

With the <code>file_field_tag</code> part you are telling Rails that it should not put the photo attachment in the main form object but rather create a second hash called <code>photo</code>. In the controller we will be reading out exactly this hash and store it in the photo model. So, here is the controller code:
<pre lang="ruby">class ArticlesController < ApplicationController   

	def update     @article = Article.find(params[:id])     
		respond_to do |format|       
			if @article.update_attributes(params[:article])           
			if params[:photo]              
				puts "Photo found"              
				# read out the POSTDATA hash 'photo' and try to create a photo 
				# also associate it with the article
				@article.photos.create!(:uploaded_data=>params[:photo]) #if image.size != 0
          	end
          format.html { redirect_to(@article, :notice => 'Article was successfully updated. [PUT]') }
          format.xml  { head :ok }
      else
        format.html { render :action => "edit" }
        format.xml  { render :xml => @article.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end

end{% endhighlight %}
I couldn't find a good tutorial on how this is done so I hope someone wanting to do the same will find this page. Happy coding.
