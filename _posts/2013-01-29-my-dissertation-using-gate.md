Not quite 4 years ago I left university. I did fairly well on my final
dissertation and have been meaning to publish it for quite some time but
never actually did it.

####So, how do I access an array in a Handlebar template?

The syntax is the following: `{{ "{{ array.[index] " }}}}`

####An example from an app I'm building right now

```html
  <div>dfskfhdskfjhsd</div>>
```
