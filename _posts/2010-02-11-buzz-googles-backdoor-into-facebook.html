Having activated and quickly turned off again GMail's new feature I was left wondering why a great email reader was being polluted by some shitty Twitter crap. I like my communication formal and simply don't have the need to tell the world in a scattergun approach what I am currently doing.

Buzz in itself is also not very Googley so I was scratching my head what it was all about. Then I read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/02/09/09readwriteweb-how-google-buzz-is-disruptive-open-data-sta-81676.html">column in the New York Times</a>:
<blockquote>Facebook and Twitter will face renewed pressure to publish and consume  standardized data feeds as well now.  If Buzz is big enough, it could  break the dam holding back a flood of standardized data.  Where there is  standized (sic) data, there is scalable network effects, consumer choice,  competition and thus innovation.</blockquote>
Maybe Google isn't really interested in providing another me-too product. Maybe they want to pry open Facebook and their social data feeds so they can organise and rank them, making them useful for their users. Think of a Google Reader for Twitter/Facebook/Friendfeed. Then do what Google does best and slap a few ads in it and bingo! As always Google isn't really a content provider but rather a way to channel all the available content out there and make it into a neat, bite-size parcel. That's what made them what they are today.
