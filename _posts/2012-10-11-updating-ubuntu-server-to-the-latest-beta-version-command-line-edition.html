I keep forgetting this, so I'm going to write it down.

Ubuntu can pick up the latest development version with a

{% highlight bash %}sudo do-release-upgrade -d # -d means development version{% endhighlight %}

But that seems to not pick up any pre-release versions if it isn't configured correctly. You must change the file <code>/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</code> and set 
{% highlight bash %}
Prompt=normal
{% endhighlight %}
