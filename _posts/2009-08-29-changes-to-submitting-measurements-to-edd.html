I have made some changes to how submitting measurements works in my <a title="Edd, an easy to use spoke length calculator" href="http://lenni.info/edd">spoke length calculator</a>, Edd. Up until now submission was anonymous, which had the obvious drawbacks of verification and me being unable to ask for clarification if a submission was unclear.

From now on you will have to supply an email address if you want to submit measurements for a hub or rim, but please be assured that this data will be for my eyes only. I won't spam you or won't give your email address to <em>anyone</em>.
