Not quite 4 years ago I left university after having graduated with a degree
in computer science. I did fairly well on my final dissertation and have
been meaning to publish it for quite some time but never actually came round
to it.

The reason that publishing this popped back into my mind was that last week
a colleague and I got chatting about a friend of his who is also wanting to
write a thesis on natural language processing.

The dissertation is titled _Automatic extraction and categorisation of
bicycle items for sale on an internet bulletin board_ and its focus is
on natural language processing using the software [GATE](http://gate.ac.uk/)
developed at the University of Sheffield.

So, if you want to read it, I've put it on
[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8fpFPFuEud6MExRcGJmVDhBc3M/edit).
From there you can also download the original PDF on the top left corner.
