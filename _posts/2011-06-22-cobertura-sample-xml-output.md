Today I was desperately looking for some sample XML that Cobertura generates, as I was writing a <a href="https://github.com/NumberFour/jscoverage-cobertura-maven-plugin">converter from jscoverage's JSON to Cobertura's XML</a>.

Turns out it is harder than it sounds but in the end I found an <a title="Cobertura Sample XML output" href="https://raw.github.com/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin/master/src/test/resources/hudson/plugins/cobertura/coverage-with-data.xml">example in the Cobertura Jenkins Plugin</a>.

So, this is just a mental note for myself in case I need it again. If you're Googling for it like myself, hopefully you'll stumble over this and say hi in the comments.
