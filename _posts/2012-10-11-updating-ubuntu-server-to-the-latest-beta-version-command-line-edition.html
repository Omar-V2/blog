I keep forgetting this, so I'm going to write it down.

Ubuntu can pick up the latest development version with a

<pre lang="bash">sudo do-release-upgrade -d # -d means development version</pre>

But that seems to not pick up any pre-release versions if it isn't configured correctly. You must change the file <code>/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</code> and set 
<pre lang="bash">
Prompt=normal
</pre>
