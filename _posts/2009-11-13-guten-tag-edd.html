If you are a regular user of the <a href="http://lenni.info/edd">Edd, the spoke length calculator</a> you may have noticed that there is a new little drop-down box at the top right hand corner which lets you select between different languages. That's right, Edd is going to be available in multiple languages.

At the moment this is limited to only English and German, but as soon as the last few kinks of theinternationalisation have been ironed out, I will try to add more languages.

In the meanwhile, if you find something that has been translated incorrectly or something that hasn't been translated at all, make sure to let me know either in the comments to this post or by writing an email to lenniboy@gmail.com.
<h2>Terve!</h2>
Pekka L has provided a Finnish translation: <a href="http://lenni.info/edd/fi">http://lenni.info/edd/fi</a>.

Thanks Pekka.
