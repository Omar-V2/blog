This week at work I had to do some tricky debugging of some HTTP headers. Unfortunately, there are no special purpose HTTP tools available for OS X and I really needed to look at the raw headers. Developer tools like Firebug and Web Inspector only show you the HTTP headers they think you are interested in, but not all.

Well, there is one widely used <em>packet</em> sniffing tools available for OS X: wireshark. but they need a lot of command line tweaking of filters in order to be useful for analysing HTTP traffic. In the end, however, I managed and will show you how I did it.

First install wireshark. I'm using macports so for me this was a

<pre lang="bash">
sudo port install wireshark
</pre>

Then you'll want to listen on a specific interface for traffic. In my case that was <code>en1</code>. You must also tell tshark, the command line version of wireshark, that you're interested in HTTP traffic, but not all the SYN/ACK packets that do the connection handshake with <code>-f "tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)"</code>

<pre>tshark -i en1 \
-f "tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)" \
-R "ip.addr==46.137.106.50 and http.request.uri contains graph" -V</pre>

In my case I found out later that Safari was sending an <code>Authorization</code> header, which I couldn't see in the Resources tag in Web Inspector.
