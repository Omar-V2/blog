<h4><a href="http://lenni.info/edd/">Edd, an easy to use spoke length calculator for bicycle wheel builders</a></h4>
This tool is useful if you want to build your own bicycle wheel (who doesn't?!). It is written almost entirely in JavaScript with a small server-side component in Python.
<h4><a href="http://lenni.me/tools/overdrive/">Overdrive delicious.com</a></h4>
A web application that makes use of the brand new implementation of theÂ <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/">HTML5-offline storage</a> specification in Apple's Safari browser. It keeps a local cache of your delicious bookmarks which are, thanks to a SQL database embedded into the client-side, extremely fast to search. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Although there is nothing Safari-specific in this application, Safari is the only browser that is currently supporting the standard.</span>

<strong>Edit:</strong> Actually, Safari 5 seems to have removed this feature, too. I think that was because the HTML5 spec is too much in flux with regards to local storgage. Mozilla has submitted a competing proposal which isn't based on SQL but rather on a key-value store and nobody seems to know what the standard will diverge on.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">

This is my reworking of an old Sun tool, that creates Javadoc-style documentation for JSP .tag files. Hosted on bitbucket.
