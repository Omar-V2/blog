I just started a new job where git is being used and since I had accumulated some stuff in mit <code>.gitconfig</code>, I wanted it to be on my work computer too. I use a git repository for all my dotfiles, which I then clone on the machine and symlink files like <code>.gitconfig</code> or <code>.vimrc</code> to the home directory. This means if I add something to those files at work and want to use the configuration at home too I just need to commit, push and pull the changes at home.

Well, this works pretty good until you realise that there are <em>some</em> config entries you want to be different in the two environments. Git's <code>user.email</code> is obviously such a case.
<h3>The solution</h3>
Git does not allow you to to include other configuration files in your <code>.gitconfig</code> but you can use the environment variable <code>$EMAIL</code> in order to overwrite <code>user.email</code>.

What I have done is to add the following to my <code>.bashrc</code> (which is also in the dotfiles repo):
{% highlight bash %}if [ -f .host-specific.sh ]
then
    source .host-specific.sh
fi{% endhighlight %}
This loads a host-specific bash file (if it exists). In this file you'll stick your email address like this:
{% highlight bash %}export EMAIL=lenni@work.com{% endhighlight %}
(Obviously this file needs to be recreated on each host and can't be shared across computers through the dotfile repository.)

Now you can safely share your <code>.gitconfig</code> between the two computers without having to worry about the email settings.
