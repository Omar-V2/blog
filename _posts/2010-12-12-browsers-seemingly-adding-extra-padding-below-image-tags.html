Today I found out about a little CSS quirk/feature (haven't quite decided yet): Image tags are being assigned a seemingly undeserved 5px of padding-bottom. The weird thing is that this does not show up as padding in Firebug/Web Inspector - my CSS reset had already set it to 0. The image probably illustrates better what I mean - see the little extra space below?

<a href="http://lenni.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-12-at-18.18.33.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-417" title="Extra padding at the bottom of the image" src="http://lenni.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-12-at-18.18.33-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a>

Well, it turns out that images are inline elements, which means they have extra space at the bottom for the letter 'tails'. These are the lines that go a little lower than the rest in such letters as y, p or q.

The solution is to apply <code>display:block</code> to the images in question.
