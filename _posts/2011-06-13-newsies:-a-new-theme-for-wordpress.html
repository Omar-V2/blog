As of late got a little bored by my old yellow blog theme. So when I stumbled over Alasdair Monk's Tumblr theme <a href="http://newsiesdemo.tumblr.com/">Newsies</a>. It was exactly what I wanted:
<ul>
	<li>clean lines</li>
	<li>a bit of playfulness (but not too much)</li>
	<li>nice typography</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, there wasn't a port available for Wordpress but after I emailed Alasdair, he was kind enough to allow me to port the theme to Wordpress.

So, if you are reading this blog on my normal website rather than in an RSS reader you'll already see the new theme.

If you're interested in the source, I put it up on <a href="https://github.com/lenniboy/newsies">my Github</a>. As always, feel free to send me improvements through Github. I have also submitted the theme to wordpress.org but as of writing this, it hadn't been accepted yet.
