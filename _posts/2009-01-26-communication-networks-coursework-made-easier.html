I have written a little script that converts the raw text file from the <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/COMP6007/CW/Regression_coursework.html">course website</a> and gives you a file with comma separated values. CSV files can be opened by any old spreadsheet program. It has the added bonus of converting the RTT from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation">scientific notation</a> to normal decimal numbers.

The script is written in Python so you need to have that installed; OS X and Linux will have it out of the box. If you have Windows and don't want to install Python you can use the lab computers at UCL.

The script is <a href="http://vocabforbreakfast.railsplayground.net/txt2csv.py">here</a>.

Download the .py file in the same directory as the coursework .txt and then run

<code>python txt2csv.py &lt;yourinputfile.txt&gt;</code>

This should create a file called coursework.csv. If you find a bug please stick it in the comments.
