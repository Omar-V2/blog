I didn't think I would see this day but today I clicked on an ad for Microsoft Azure on Stackoverflow and saw that Azure is offering <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?scenario=virtual-machines">Ubuntu Linux instances</a>! After picking up my jaw from the floor, I just had to share this with the world.

I had never even looked at Azure, as I'm a happy AWS customer, so this could be old news but most articles talking about Ubuntu on Azure are dated 7th of June 2012 so I take it this is pretty new.

It's pretty obvious that MS is mightily scared of being left out of the two computing markets that are growing like crazy right now: mobile and cloud computing. Exciting times ahead.
