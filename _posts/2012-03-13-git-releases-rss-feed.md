I've been following the git releases quite closely lately but I haven't been able to find a RSS feed for the release notes. To scratch this itch I have written a <a title="Script on Github" href="https://github.com/leonardehrenfried/git-releases-feed">little Ruby script</a> that scrapes the git homepage and puts the release notes in an RSS feed ready for consumption.

If you want to subscribe to the feed add this URL to your feed reader:Â <a href="http://lenni.info/git-releases.rss.xml">http://lenni.info/git-releases.rss.xml</a>

The feed is updated every 8 hours.
